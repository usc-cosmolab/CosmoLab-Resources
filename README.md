# CosmoLab-Resources
A collection of resources and information put together by the members of Cosmolab at USC. 

## CosmoLab Wiki
The Wiki for this repository contains "write-ups" on helpful information on a range of topics from coding tips, literature overviews, and more. Pages can be created and edited by any member (see Wiki home page for details).

## Members Folder

The members folder contains a folder under each member's name where they can add any materials they want (longer pieces of code, notes, etc.). Each folder should only be edited by its owner, and materials in the members folders can be referenced in the Wiki pages.
